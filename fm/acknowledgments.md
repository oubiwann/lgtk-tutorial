## The PyGTK Tutorial

Thanks to:

* Nathan Hurst for the Plugs and Sockets section.
* Alex Roitman for the FileChooser section.
* Steve George for the example program illustrating editable CellRendererText and activatable CellRendererToggle.
* Charles Wilson for the "How to Separate Callback Methods From Signal Handlers" section in the "Tips For Writing PyGTK Applications" chapter.

Much of Section 4.1, “Theory of Packing Boxes” was adapted from the PyGTK FAQ item 12.2 How does packing work (or how do I get my widget to stay the size I want) as it existed on 21 October 2008, and had been originally written by Christian Reis.
